# Authentication with JWT


## Signup

### `User` Model
Before even adding authentication with JWT, we need to setup signup. In order to do this, we need 3 things:

- A User Model
- An `/api/signup` route
- Saving the user to the database

This time we're going to use `passport-local-mongoose` to make user registration and login easier.

Let's add the packages first:

```sh
npm install --save mongoose passport-local-mongoose
```

_Note_: It's more than a passport strategy and we're actually going to use it for that. We're not going to use it's built-in strategy.

Let's create the User model, `models/user.js`:

```js
const mongoose = require('mongoose');
const passportLocalMongoose = require('passport-local-mongoose');
const { Schema } = mongoose;

const userSchema = new Schema({
  // the username and password are added by passportLocalMongoose
  // we can add any extra information like facebooktokens (or
  // others) as well as a picture, etc
  name: String
});

userSchema.plugin(passportLocalMongoose);

module.exports = mongoose.model('User', userSchema);
```

### Signup Route

Now we can use the User model to signup users. As always, let's create the `routes/auth.js`:

```js
const express = require('express');
const router = express.Router();
const User = require('../models/user');

router.post('/signup', (req, res, next) => {
  // extract the info we need from the body
  // of the request
  const {
    username,
    name,
    password
  } = req.body;

  // create the new user
  // notice how we don't pass the password because
  // we're letting User.register add the hashed version
  // for us
  const user = new User({
    username,
    name
  });

  User.register(user, password, (err) => {
    if (err) {
      return next(err)
    }
    res.json({ success: true })
  })
});

```

Don't forget to add the `authRoutes` to the `app` in `app.js`:

```js
const index = require('./routes/index');
const authRoutes = require("./routes/auth");

app.use('/', index);
app.use('/api', authRoutes);
```

- _Try creating a user with Postman_
- _What happens if you don't provide a username?_
- _Are you able to create the same user multiple times?_

## Signin

### JWT?

To authenticate the user we're no longer going to use cookies. We are going to use **J**SON **W**eb **T**okens (JWT for short). This is simply a string generated by the server (that's what we call a token) that is sent to the user after we verify his credentials. The user must save it somewhere and send it everytime he makes a new request. The server will be able to verify the token and even decrypt it to get who sent it.

We're going to start by installing some packages:

```sh
npm install --save jwt-simple passport passport-jwt
```

Let's create a `config.js` file where we're going to put some configuration for JWT:

```js
module.exports = {
  // This secret should be in an environment variable instead
  jwtSecret: process.env.JWT_SECRET || "MyS3cr3tK3Y",
  jwtSession: {
    session: false
  }
};
```

We're going to require this file at multiple places.

### Passport + JWT

Let's setup passport with a new strategy using the JWT. Require these packages at the top of your `app.js` file:

```js
const passport = require("passport");
const User = require("./models/user");
const config = require("./config");
const { Strategy, ExtractJwt } = require("passport-jwt");
```

Then, just after adding the `bodyParser` middleware and before adding our `authRoutes`, initialise passport and add the strategy:

```js
app.use(passport.initialize())
// Create the strategy for JWT
const strategy = new Strategy(
  {
    // this is a config we pass to the strategy
    // it needs to secret to decrypt the payload of the
    // token.
    secretOrKey: config.jwtSecret,
    // This options tells the strategy to extract the token
    // from the header of the request
    jwtFromRequest: ExtractJwt.fromAuthHeader()
  },
  (payload, done) => {
    // payload is the object we encrypted at the route /api/token
    // We get the user id, make sure the user exist by looking it up
    User.findById(payload.id).then(user => {
      if (user) {
        // make the user accessible in req.user
        done(null, user);
      } else {
        done(new Error("User not found"));
      }
    });
  }
);
// tell pasport to use it
passport.use(strategy);
```

Finally we need to add the `/api/login` route in `auth.js`, but first let's require some packages at the top of the file:

```js
const jwt = require("jwt-simple");
const passport = require("passport");
const config = require("../config");
```

Now we can add a new `login` _POST_ route:

```js
// User.authenticate() returns a function
const authenticate = User.authenticate();
router.post("/login", (req, res, next) => {
  const { username, password } = req.body;
  // check if we have a username and password
  if (username && password) {
    // test if the credentials are valid
    authenticate(username, password, (err, user, failed) => {
      if (err) {
        // an unexpected error from the database
        return res.status(500).json(err);
      }
      if (failed) {
        // failed logging (bad password, too many attempts, etc)
        return res.status(401).json(failed.message);
      }
      if (user) {
        // success!! Save the user id
        // NEVER save the password here
        // the id is usually enough because we can get back
        // the actual user by fetching the database later
        const payload = {
          id: user.id
        };
        // generate a token and send it
        // this token will contain the user.id encrypted
        // only the server is able to decrypt it
        // for the client, this is just a token, he knows that
        // he has to send it
        const token = jwt.encode(payload, config.jwtSecret);
        res.json({ token });
      }
    });
  } else {
    // unauthorized error
    res.sendStatus(401);
  }
});
```

- _Try to login using the previously created users_
- _Try using a bad password_
- _Compare tokens when login in with different users_

## Protecting routes

Now that we are able to send the user a token, we can protect routes from anonymous users and identify the users that are doing some requests.

It's now super easy thanks to passport. We only need to use `passport.authenticate('jwt')` as a middleware to protect a route and ensure that we have access to `req.user`. Add this route after adding the `authRoutes` in `app.js`:

```js
// This is an example of protected route
app.get(
  "/api/secret",
  // this is protecting the route and giving us access to
  // req.user
  passport.authenticate("jwt", config.jwtSession),
  (req, res) => {
    // send the user his own information
    res.json(req.user);
  }
);

```

But... how do we pass the token we got earlier when doing a request?
We have to pass it in the headers of all the requests we make. When using Postman, head over to the _Headers_ tab and add a new entry with `Authorization` as the key and `JWT <replace this with the jwt>` as the value.

When building a front end application you'll probably use something like [axios](https://github.com/mzabriskie/axios). In that case you need to set the token like this:

```js
axios.defaults.headers.common['Authorization'] = 'JWT ' + <replace this with the jwt>;
```

This will make any request send the token in the headers of such request.

## Logout

What about logout? Well, there's actually no such thing as a logout with JWT, **you just stop sending the token**. With axios that would be deleting the previously added token:

```js
delete axios.defaults.headers.common['Authorization']
```
